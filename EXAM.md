Project Specifics
---------------------------

Refactor App into Microservices and Deploy

## Containers and Microservices

### Criteria

Divide an application into microservices

- `/feed` and `/user` backends are separated into  
independent projects.

- Build and run a container image using Docker

- Project includes Dockerfiles to successfully create Docker images for `/feed`, `/user` backends, project frontend, and reverse proxy.

- Screenshot of DockerHub shows the images.

## Independent Releases and Deployments

### Criteria

- Use Travis to build a CI/CD pipeline

- Project includes a `.travis.yml` file.

- Screenshot of the Travis CI interface shows a successful build and deploy job.

## Service Orchestration with Kubernetes

### Criteria

- Deploy microservices using a Kubernetes cluster on AWS

- A screenshots of `kubectl` commands show the Frontend and API projects deployed in Kubernetes.

- The output of `kubectl get pods` indicates that the pods are running successfully with the `STATUS` value `Running`.

- The output of `kubectl describe services` does not expose any sensitive strings such as database passwords.

- Use a reverse proxy to direct requests to the appropriate backend

- Screenshot of Kubernetes services shows a reverse proxy

- Configure scaling and self-healing for each service

- Kubernetes services are replicated. At least one of the Kubernetes services has `replicas:` defined with a value greater than 1 in its`deployment.yml` file.

- Screenshot of Kubernetes cluster of command `kubectl describe hpa` has autoscaling configured with CPU metrics.

## Debugging, Monitoring, and Logging

### Criteria

- Use logs to capture metrics for debugging a microservices deployment

- Screenshot of one of the backend API pod logs indicates user activity that is logged when an API call is made.

## Advanced improvements (Optional)
1.  Improve logging with request IDâ€™s
2.  Reduce duplicate code in back end code
3.  Secure AWS resources for least-privileged access for IAM roles
4.  Create dependency graph of application services and AWS resources
